# Contributing to AI VFX Pipeline

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the requirements if you add new dependencies
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yavru421/AI_VFX_3/issues)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
